First you insert your input key, the key you press to use the macro. (Quick note: most special keys like L-Shift, L-CTRL, L-ALT etc. dont work with this macro)
Then you input a start/stop macro button. This is kind of a permission button. Macro will start/stop working when this button is pressed. 
Lastly you simply insert the key you want spammed.
